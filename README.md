> DoThat is a simple CLI to-do application for the old-schools who love to work and stick around with the terminal rather than jumping forth with your working terminal and your desktop. DoThat saves your needed tasks and you can mark it done as soon as you finish it with just a command - it's as simple as that. 

## Install

```sh
npx do_that_1.2
```
